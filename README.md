# 👋 Hi, I'm Sri Murari Dachepalli!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a passionate **Data Scientist** and **Computer Science Master's Student** at **The George Washington University**, with a background in **data engineering**, **machine learning**, and **cloud technologies**. I enjoy solving complex problems and continuously learning new skills.

## 🎓 Education
- **Master of Science in Computer Science**, *The George Washington University* (Expected: June 2026)  
- **Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science**, *Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management* (Graduated: May 2023)  
  CGPA: **8.89/10**

## 💼 Work Experience
- **Data Analyst at Tiger Analytics** (Oct 2023 - Jul 2024)  
  I contributed to **pricing optimization**, **data pipeline automation**, and **predictive modeling** using tools like **PySpark**, **SQL**, and **Python**. My work resulted in a **reduction in processing time** and significant improvements in the model's performance.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, SQL
- **Tools & Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PySpark, dbt
- **Cloud & Platforms**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Azure Databricks
- **Databases**: MySQL, SQLite
- **Softwares**: Tableau, Microsoft Suite
- **Data Engineering**: ETL, Data Pipelines, Pandas UDF, Data Warehousing
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## 🔬 Research Work
### **1. Assiduous Study of the Hyperparameters’ Influence on CNN Using COVID-19 CT Images**
   - **Objective**: Conducted research on the impact of hyperparameters on the performance of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** in analyzing **COVID-19 CT scan images**.
   - **Research Details**:
     - Collaborated with a 4-person team to optimize CNN models for higher accuracy by exploring hyperparameter settings like layer count, epochs, image orientation, clarity, and activation functions.
     - After initial research, observed overfitting with training accuracy around 90% and test accuracy at 76%. By implementing **DenseNet architecture**, we improved accuracies to **90% (train)** and **89% (test)**.
     - Conducted experiments on multiple platforms: **CPU**, **GPU**, **HPC**, and **Quantum machines**. (Extended Research Work - This is done using DenseNet (Not Published)
   - **Outcomes**: Published research paper and presented findings at the **ICISC 2023 conference**, which helped advance the understanding of hyperparameter optimization in CNNs for medical imaging.
